# Unsupervised-Learning-Challenge

In this challenge, we use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

We plot an elbow curve using k values from 1 to 11. Based on the elbow, the optimal k value for our model is 4.

We also used PCA data to plot the elbow, which returned 4 as the best k value.


Using Fewer features (k=2) results in steeper inertia for the elbow curve. Although we notice that a K value of 4 is still optimal. We also observe that the data clusters although reduced, display the same concentration and outliers.
